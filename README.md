# SnowMake
A simple unique 2D snowflake generator and educational website hobby project

Snowmakes is currently hosted on heroku at http://snowmakes.herokuapp.com/ using the Flask python framework in the backend.

It makes unique two dimensional snowflake patterns on demand, and sends a gif of the snowflake growing to be displayed on the website.
In advanced mode, you can play with features such as the starting height and humidity, to reduce some of the randomness, 
and better understand the influencing factors into snowflake generation. (although remember real snowflakes are 3D and even more complex!)

In the about section I try to explain how the app works, and how it relates to real snowflakes. 

Happy SnowMaking!
